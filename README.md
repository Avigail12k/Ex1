My name is Avigail im A  Computer Science student at Ariel University
I wrote this project  as number formatting converter and calculator. 
It allows you to convert numbers represented as strings in bases between 2 and 16 to decimal, and perform basic arithmetic operations on them.
The program also finds the maximum value in an array of numbers
